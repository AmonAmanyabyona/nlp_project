This is not in the least from unwillingness to allow freedom to others. On the contrary, no man would more enjoy a manly resistance to his thought. But it is the impulse of a mind accustomed to follow out its own impulse, as the hawk its prey, and which knows not how to stop in the chase. Carlyle, indeed, is arrogant and overbearing; but in his arrogance there is no littleness,\u2014no self-love. It is the heroic arrogance of some old Scandinavian conqueror;\u2014it is his nature, and the untameable impulse that has given him power to crush the dragons.'''"

It is one of those adamantine tendernesses which are the touchstones of every age and race. If other things are against it, other things must go down. If landlords and laws and sciences are against it, landlords and laws and sciences must go down. With the red hair of one she-urchin in the gutter I will set fire to all modern civilization. Because a girl should have long hair, she should have clean hair; because she should have clean hair, she should not have an unclean home: because she should not have an unclean home, she should have a free and leisured mother; because she should have a free mother, she should not have an usurious landlord; because there should not be an usurious landlord, there should be a redistribution of property; because there should be a redistribution of property, there shall be a revolution. That little urchin with the gold-red hair, whom I have just watched toddling past my house, she shall not be lopped and lamed and altered; her hair shall not be cut short like a convict's; no, all the kingdoms of the earth shall be hacked about and mutilated to suit her. She is the human and sacred image; all around her the social fabric shall sway and split and fall; the pillars of society shall be shaken, and the roofs of ages come rushing down, and not one hair of her head shall be harmed.'''"

And as I close this chaotic volume I open again the strange small book from which all Christianity came; and I am again haunted by a kind of confirmation. The tremendous figure which fills the Gospels towers in this respect, as in every other, above all the thinkers who ever thought themselves tall. His pathos was natural, almost casual. The Stoics, ancient and modern, were proud of concealing their tears. He never concealed His tears; He showed them plainly on His open face at any daily sight, such as the far sight of His native city. Yet He concealed something. Solemn supermen and imperial diplomatists are proud of restraining their anger. He never restrained His anger. He flung furniture down the front steps of the Temple, and asked men how they expected to escape the damnation of Hell. Yet He restrained something. I say it with reverence; there was in that shattering personality a thread that must be called shyness. There was something that He hid from all men when He went up a mountain to pray. There was something that He covered constantly by abrupt silence or impetuous isolation. There was some one thing that was too great for God to show us when He walked upon our earth; and I have sometimes fancied that it was His mirth.'''"

If they do accept the call to the faith, they must then be called upon to pay jizyah, or capitation tax, because the Prophet directed the commanders of his armies so to do, and also because by submitting to this tax war is forbidden and terminated upon the authority of the Qur\u2019an. (This call to pay capitation tax, however, respects only those from whom the capitation tax is acceptable, or, as to apostates and the idolaters of Arabia, to call upon them to pay the tax is useless, since nothing is accepted from them but embracing the faith, as it is thus commanded in the Qur\u2019an). If those who are called upon to pay capitation tax consent to do so, they then become entitled to the same protection and subject to the same rules as Muslims because \u2018Ali had declared infidels agree to a capitation tax only in order to render their blood the same as Muslims\u2019 blood, and their property the same as Muslims\u2019 property."

But I also wanted to thank everyone who's not watching, because they're probably out making something, building something, doing something, fixing something. For too many people, the only thing they know is how to make an excuse. \"It was too hard\". \"Didn't feel good\". \"They sent the wrong part\". I've been thinking a lot about makers and takers, you know? Because I had something very valuable taken from me. Somebody took my truck. 10 years of attention to detail... poof, gone. It's an empty feeling, like when John Elway retired. Wow. Am I sad? Yeah, I'm sad. And I did what I always do when I get sad: eat some pork and remember Ronald Reagan... the Gipper... and the verse he quoted when he lost the GOP nomination. \"Though I am hurt, I am not slain. I lay me down to bleed a while. Then I'll rise and fight again\". I loved every moment of that show... I mean truck. It was a classic from a simpler, happier time. You know... the truck. And that's something that can't be stolen from me. What kind of punks steal other people's stuff? Make something yourself, men. My mother was right. She always quoted this famous comedian... and I can't remember his name... who said, \"Men are pigs. Oh, oh, oh!\". Baxter out."

At that time, life for a hacker like me was just a complex system of algorithms written in a programming language on which there were no manuals. In other words, I was one of those for whom living meant learning how to manage their software every day without having had the opportunity to take courses or the time for exercises or tests. Life was what it was, and a very short one at that; Mine was to keep myself permanently occupied, without thinking about anything that had nothing to do with what I was doing from moment to moment, especially if, as then, I was committing a crime punishable by law."

Those who were vague about similar and even more bizarre etymological interpretations would find, in certain books, plenty of them; but what seems credible is only this: that the Chalcidians who came to found Naxos under Taormina, in 758 B.C., and advanced six or eight years later, under the guidance of Evarcus, to the southern slopes of Etna, did not found Catania, but simply put their colony in the city, the origin of which is lost in the mists of time.  one reads from ancient writers that in a very remote age the earthquakes of Etna caused the collapse of \"the boreal walls with the towers, the first work of the Cyclops\"\n\n==="
